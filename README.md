# create-svelte
Spinned Up using [`SvelteKit`](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).
## 👩🏾‍💻 ✨ Developing ✨ 👩🏼‍💻

Once you've pulled this project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
The Tailwind is all linked up where it needs to go, look over this if you want: [`Tailwind/SvelteKit`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/sveltekit)

Add a `newpage.svelte` to the /routes folder to create a new page for your website/app. It can be seen in `localhost:3000/newpage`

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
