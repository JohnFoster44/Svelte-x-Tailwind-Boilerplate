# Svelte x Tailwind

Super quick 'n' easy to get cracking with this. The 🌍 is ur 🦪!

Spinned Up using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

## 👩🏾‍💻 ✨ Developing ✨ 👩🏼‍💻

Once you've pulled this project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
The Tailwind is all linked up where it needs to go, look over this if you want - by the Tailwind team: [Tailwind/SvelteKit](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/sveltekit)

Add a `newpage.svelte` to the `/routes` folder to create a new page for your app. It can be seen in `localhost:3000/newpage` and so on.

## 👷🏽 ✨ Building ✨ 👷🏽

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
